<p>Theme (if you need one): Innocent but crazy</p>
<p>Collective: Apart from Gary and Ippy this party has no organization. You are invited to join the collective by helping a hand here and there.
</p>
<p>Surroundings: We are close to a residential area and in the middle of a beautiful park, so please behave accordingly: no open drug use and try to keep the volume down outside!
</p>
<p>No cops = no problems, let’s make sure they don’t come. Most important: always close the venue door behind you! Feel free to volunteer as door watcher! (Cops = 300 euro bond lost, and early closing).
</p>
<p>Fire: We have a fire place but there are some clear rules so make sure you know them!
</p>
<p>Chillout: There is a nice forest outside, if you bring your hammocks, tarps or other chill items we can make a nice chill out.
</p>
<p>Leave no trace! That is: no cigarette buds, no bottle caps on the ground, please use the trash bags and ashtrays. Full trash bag? Take a new one.
</p>
<p>Sunday at noon we have to hand back the keys. You are welcome to stay as long as you like, as long as you help us make the deadline! :)
</p>
<p>Donations: We will hang a donation QR code. Feel free to donate.
